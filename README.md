Hi there! 👋
I'm Ankit, a software engineering student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. 

I have a passion for programming and have worked on some exciting projects, including weather detection and a to-do list app.

🌦️ **Weather Detection Project**: This project involved using data from various sources to analyze and predict weather patterns. 
It was a great opportunity to apply my programming skills to real-world scenarios.

✅ **To-Do List App**: I developed a simple and intuitive to-do list application using HTML,CSS and java script
which helped me enhance my understanding of web development.

🚀 Currently, I'm diving deeper into DSA and exploring web development.
I'm familiar with programming languages like C, C++, Java, and Python. Additionally,
I have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or want to collaborate on exciting projects.
